# ActionScript Loose Typing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in ActionScript related to loose typing and the use of the `arguments` object within functions.  The bug arises from making assumptions about the types of arguments passed to a function without explicit type checking.

## Bug Description

In ActionScript, functions don't explicitly define the types of their arguments. This flexibility can lead to runtime errors if you assume a specific type for an argument and the actual type is different. The `arguments` object, which provides access to the arguments passed to a function, further complicates type handling if not carefully managed.

## Solution

The solution involves adding explicit type checking to ensure that the arguments passed to the function conform to the expected types. This avoids unexpected behavior and prevents runtime errors.  Type checking can be done before processing arguments or by using more structured data types.
